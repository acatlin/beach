## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# install.packages("tidymodels")

library(tidymodels)
# library(modeldata) # This is also loaded by the tidymodels package
# data(ames)
data(ames, package = "modeldata")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

dim(ames)

View(ames)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
